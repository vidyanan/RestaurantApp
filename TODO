Omar's Notes:
  [ ] POST, PUT, PATCH endpoints should use request body instead of query params
  [ ] Use req.json(object) instead of req.send(object)
  [ ] Use req.end() instead of req.send()
  [ ] Avoid excessive dependency on order of children! search ".children["
  [x] Rename restaurant.url to restaurant.slug
